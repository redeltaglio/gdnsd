/*
 *   This header defines two data types named stats_t and stats_uint_t, and a
 * number of related functions.  These are built on C11 atomics and are
 * intended to implement fast cross-thread statistical counters which have a
 * single writer (owner) thread but can be read consistently by another thread
 * as stats data.  The general pattern is that the stats storage (a struct
 * containing many stats_t) is allocated and written to as a per-thread chunk
 * of memory, and the stats reporter thread has pointers to all threads'
 * structures and is responsible for reading them all and summing them into a
 * global stats output when requested by users or other software.
 *
 * Rules:
 * 1) One thread is the "owner" of a stats_t (or a block of them), and is the
 *    only thread performing write operations to the value, via
 *    stats_own_{inc,add}().
 * 2) Non-owner threads only read the data, using stats_get().
 * 3) The usage of the stats_t must be such that there are no data dependencies
 *    on it for correctness.  In other words: pay attention to the word "stats"
 *    in the type name; this is intended for storing and retrieving statistical
 *    data which have no bearing on correct program execution.
 *
 *   stats_uint_t is a regular, non-atomic unsigned type of the same width as
 * stats_t.  You can store the result of stats_get() in such a type to cache it
 * thread-locally for a while in cases where that makes sense.
 *
 *   The width of the type and thus the max stat value before rollover is
 * chosen as the platform's pointer type, as this is safely lock/tear-free
 * across a broad range of platforms.  We make an exception for the x86_64
 * "x32" ILP32 ABI and give it a 64-bit long long type even though it has
 * 32-bit pointers.
